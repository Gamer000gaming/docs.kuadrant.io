The site configuration and navigation layout are defined in [./mkdocs.yml](./mkdocs.yml).
The navigation sections follow the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), with four main areas:

- Concepts (known as 'Explanation' in Diátaxis)
- APIs & Reference
- Tutorials
- Guides

When adding new documentation, take a moment to consider which area the document belongs to.
You can use the [Diátaxis compass](https://diataxis.fr/compass/) to help answer that question.
If you are unsure, raise an issue, create a PR anyways to invite discussion, or reach out on the [#kuadrant](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05J0D0V525) slack channel.

When writing content, refer to the [./style_guide.md](./style_guide.md) for writing style guidelines, tips and examples.
